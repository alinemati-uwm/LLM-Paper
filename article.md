| Patchscopes: A Unifying Framework for Inspecting Hidden Representations of Language Models | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06102v2.pdf | | | The paper introduces Patchscopes, a framework for inspecting hidden representations of large language models (LLMs). Patchscopes leverages the model itself to explain its internal representations in natural language. Through various configurations, the framework can answer different types of questions about an LLM's computation. | | | Patchscopes, language models, hidden representations, interpretability, next-token predictions, attribute extraction, entity resolution, multi-hop reasoning, cross-model patching. |
